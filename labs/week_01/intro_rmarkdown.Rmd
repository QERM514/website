# What is R Markdown?

Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, MS Word documents, and many other document formats. When you click the "Knit" button in **RStudio**, a document will be generated that includes both text content as well as the output of any embedded **R** code chunks within the document. Markdown is written in plain text, which means you can use any text editor to writing or editing Markdown documents. For a much more detailed treatment of R Markdown and its inner workings, please see the [resources page](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html) from RStudio.

# Document layout

## Front Matter (YAML)

Every Markdown document begins with a section of plain text written in [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) ("YAML Ain't Markup Language"). This block of human readable code is used to define some of the document's metadata such as the title, author, and date. It is also used to specify the document's format (eg, HTML or pdf) and its layout (eg, theme, font).

The front matter is defined in a block of text that begins and ends with 3 dashes `---`. For example, here is the YAML for a simple HTML document:

```
---
title: "I really like R Markdown"
author: "Mark Scheuerell"
date: "3 April 2020"
output: html_document
---
```

The YAML can include a lot more information as well, including fields for various pre-defined themes, a table of contents, adding citations and formatting references, and whether to use other files as formatting templates. For example, here is the YAML for this document:

```
---
title: "Introduction to R Markdown"
author: "Mark Scheuerell"
date: "3 April 2020"
output:
  html_document:
    theme: journal
    highlight: textmate
    toc: true
    toc_float: true
    toc_depth: 3
---
```

## Body

The body of a Markdown document can contain a mix of variously formatted text, equations, and code. The code can be written so that it is executed upon "knitting" the document with the output displayed in the document or hidden from view. The code can also be flagged so that it is only shown for example purposes and not actually executed.

# Writing text

The text in a Markdown document can be formatting in a number of ways. At a basic level, it's just various forms of text that are converted to nicely formatted features when the file is rendered.

## Headings

You can specify different levels of headings using the hashtag (pound) symbol `#`. By adding more `#` signs you can decrease the heading level. So, for example, the following

```
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
```

will render to 

> # Heading 1
> ## Heading 2
> ### Heading 3
> #### Heading 4

## Emphasis

### Italics

It's easy to add emphasis to text. For *italic* face, wrap the text with either a single asterisk (`*`) or an underscrore (`_`). For example,

```
This is *italic*, but then so is _this_.
```

will render to 

> This is *italic*, but then so is _this_.

### Bold

For **bold** face, wrap the text with either two asterisks (`**`) or an underscrores (`__`). For example,

```
This is **bold**, but then so is __this__.
```

will render to 

> This is **bold**, but then so is __this__.

### Bold & italic

For combined ***bold and italics*** face, wrap the text with three asterisks (`***`), such that

```
This is ***bold and italic***.
```

renders to

> This is ***bold and italic***.

### Strikethrough

If you want to indicate a deletion or ~~strikethrough~~, just wrap the text in two tilde's (`~~`), such that

```
Oops, this is ~~a mistake~~.
```

will render to 

> Oops, this is ~~a mistake~~.

### Underline

Unfortunately, Markdown does not include a built-in format for <u>underlining text</u>. You can, however, use regular HTML tags to do so. So, for example,

```
This bit is <u>underlined</u>.
```

results in

> This bit is <u>underlined</u>.

[Aside: It turns out that you can use all kinds of HTML tags within Markdown documents for additional formatting options.]


## Block quotes

You can specify a block quote by preceding it with the `>` symbol, such that

```
> Four score and seven years ago... 
```

yields

> Four score and seven years ago...

## Lists

You can include ordered (numbered) lists, unordered (bulleted) lists, or a combination of the two in Markdown documents as well. Numbered lists simply use a number and period (`1.`) followed by a space and the text. For example, this text

```
1. This is item 1  
2. Item 2 comes next
```
     
will render to
     
> 1. This is item 1  
> 2. Item 2 comes next

It also turns out that you don't even have to use consecutive numbers to make it work. For example,

```
1. This is item 1  
7. Item 2 comes next
```

will render to

> 1. This is item 1  
> 7. Item 2 comes next

You can specifiy unordered list with either an asterisk (`*`) or dash (`-`). For example, the following text 

```
* This is a thing 
* Here is another
- And yet another
```

will render to

> * This is a thing 
> * Here is another
> - And yet another

Mixed lists simply use a mixture of the two constructs, such that 

```
1. This is item 1
   * This is a thing
   * Here is another  
2. Item 2 comes next
   - And yet another
```

will render to

> 1. This is item 1
>    * This is a thing
>    * Here is another  
> 2. Item 2 comes next
>    - And yet another
  
## Links

### Inline

You can insert links to websites, other files, and other locations within a file. For websites, there are several options. The first is to simply write out the full address inline (eg, http://www.google.com) and it will parse correctly. You can also use shorthand text to hide the full address or make a snetence more readable. To do that, include the name in square brackets followed by the address inside parentheses For example,

```
Please conduct your search from [this link](http://www.google.com).
```

will render as

> Please conduct your search from [this link](http://www.google.com).

### Referenced

It's also possible to include a short numbered reference to the full address rather than writing it out imediately following the link's text. To do so, replace the parenthetic statement with a number inside square brackets (eg, `[1]`)., and then write out the full address *anywhere* in the document. This can be useful if you want to keep a separate section that includes all of the links within a document. So, for example, we could have written the example above as 

```
Please conduct your search from [this link][1].
```

and then provided the full address as `[1]: http://www.google.com` at the end of the section below on "Inserting pictures". If so, it would have rendered and worked just as above:

> Please conduct your search from [this link][1].

## Inserting pictures

### Inline

Inserting links to images works much the same as for websites, but you add an exclamation point (`!`) at the beginning of the construct (and the text inside the square brackets in optional). For example, here is how to include an inline link to the logo for the QERM program, which exists in the same directory as this Markdown document.

```
Check out the QERM Program's logo: ![](qerm_logo.png)
```

which will yield this

> Check out the QERM Program's logo: ![](qerm_logo.png)

### Referenced

Referenced links work just as above for websites, but instead of the site's address, include the name of the image file. For example, we could have used

```
Check out the QERM Program's logo: ![][2]
```

which yields the same result:

> Check out the QERM Program's logo: ![][2]

(NOTE that we used `[1]` for the referenced Google link above, so we used `[2]` here.)

Here are the references for the links. For some reason I put the full address here for the web link in the above section on "Referenced links", but it works just fine.

```
[1]: http://www.google.com
[2]: qerm_logo.png
```

[1]: http://www.google.com
[2]: qerm_logo.png
