# Instructions

The goal of this assignment is to introduce yourself to the instructor and get some practice working with R Markdown. Edit or add the appropriate information to this .Rmd template (be sure to look over the entire document). You may delete this instructional text from your completed assignment before submitting it for grading.

# 1) Who am I?

Provide a brief biosketch of yourself (250 words max). Feel free to include information on your background, such as where you're from, where you completed your undergraduate education, hobbies, etc. Use some kind of emphasis tag to highlight at least one thing you think is particularly noteworthy.

# 2) What do I study?

Tell me about the research you're undertaking for your thesis/dissertation (250 words max). What kinds of problems do you study? Do you do fieldwork? If so, where? What kind of data are you using?

### Keywords

Provide 3-5 key words or phrases that describe your research in an unordered list.

# 3) What do I want from this course?

Use an ordered list to identify 3 things you'd like to get out of this course.

# 4) Plot air quality data

Use the `airquality` data set included with **R** to do the following:

* insert a new code block below and give it an informative name;
* create *any* kind of plot using *any* of the data in `airquality`;
* use chunk options to make the plot 5 inches wide by 4 inches tall, and center it on the page;
* use the `fig.cap=''` option to add an informative figure caption).

Here's a peak at the data.

```{r}
## inspect the `airquality` data set
str(airquality)
```

# 5) Say it with an equation

Use the **LaTeX** math options to write a stand alone equation for a linear model that describes the relationship between a dependent variable and two different predictor variables. Follow up the equation with some text that uses inline math to describe any abbreviations used for the variables and parameters (eg, "$\beta_0$ is the intercept").

# 6) Comment on an issue in GitHub

Navigate to the *Issues* page for the course's *assistance* repo on GitHub and find the issue that Mark posted called

> **Question about GitHub for HW 1**

Click on the issue to bring up a comment box below the original comment or the responses of your classmates who have already answered this question. In the comment box, answer Mark's question posted in the first comment box.

When you are finished with your comment/answer, click the green **Comment** button. Next, click on the 3 dots in the upper right corner of your posted comment and select "Copy link" (see picture below). Include your copied url here in your answer using the the shortened link method we learned in lab. For example,

> I posted my comment on question 6 \underline{here}.

where \underline{here} includes an active link to your posted issue. Your url should look something like

> https://github.com/QERM514/assistance/issues/7#issue-587009299

where the number at the end of the url after `/issues/7#issue-...` is unique to you.
